In SpringBoot an interceptors is used to intercept HTTP request and response allows us to perform some custom
logic before and after the request is processed by controller.

IMPL:
Create a custom interceptor class and implement the HandlerInterceptor interface.
HandlerInterceptor it is part of springframework has three default methods.
Register this custom interceptor into spring framework.

1.preHandle() : Request reaches here first then we have to write custom logic and return true then it goes to controller else rejected.
2.postHandle() : Once the controller process the request but before the response is returned.
                 while processing the request if we encounter with exception , then this method is not executed.
3.afterCompletion(): Invoked after the complete request is finished.
