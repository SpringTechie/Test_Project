Logging: By writing logs in application we get to know where the issue occurred and up to which part of the code is executed.
We use @Slfy4j to write logs.
Annotate this on top of the class.
To write the logs use "log" keyword.
Example: log.info("Hello Raja");

There are diff logging levels:
1.TRACE: Very Detailed Information.
       low level debugging
2.DEBUG: Debugging Application Flow.
       During development.

3.INFO: General Application Info.
       used to show high level events
4.WARN: Non-Critical
      Something went wrong but still app is running.
5.ERROR: Critical issues:
       Application error, exceptions,or failed process.

By default info is enabled.

How to enable other log level.
logging.level.root= info
To enable only for specific package: logging.level.<package_name>= <log_level>

To store logs in file use this property
logging.file.name = <file_name>
