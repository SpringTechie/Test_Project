Spring SPEL.
SPEL stands for Spring Expression Language.
it is a powerful expression lang used to query and manipulate objects at runtime.
It injects the values dynamically.
By this annotation and expression, we can load  property from  application.properties file
Example: @Value("${name}") // this loads the name values from application properties.

When is it executed?
@Value is processed during bean creation in the Spring IoC container.
More precisely:
1.Spring scans and detects the bean (@Component, @Service, @Configuration, etc.).
2.The bean is instantiated.
3.Spring’s BeanPostProcessor (AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor) resolves annotations like @Autowired, @Value, @ConfigurationProperties.
At this point, the values are injected before the bean’s lifecycle methods (like @PostConstruct) run.

If specified key does not exist, then Spring throws BeanCreation Exception.
and we have an option to provide default value if the key is not present.
@Value("${key_name:default_value}")

By using SPEL, we can also perform mathematical operations and method calls.
    @Value("#{2+3}")
    private String age;

    @Value("#{4%2==0?18:21}")
    private String dummy;

    @Value("#{2 * T(Math).PI}")
    private int area circlearea;
